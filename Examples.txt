Issues del Feedback: 

- Reemplazar Unknown por NULL, pero, hay un problema lógico: Si pones NULL entre los verticals, sería como todos los nulls, no solo nulls para un industry. Preguntarle a Jogi

________________________________

Problema con Industries:
____________________________

Input 1:

Automotive (Mobility Services)

Central, Federal and Regional Government (Central Government)

Banking (Universal Banks)

Output:

AND OPV.IndustryName in (
'Central, Federal and Regional Government',
'Automotive',
'Banking'
)

AND IPV.VerticalName in (
'Regional Government',
'Central Government',
'Mobility Services',
'Universal Banks',
'Banking'
)

Dos problemas que veo a priori: Me está agregando más verticals, y me está agregando verticals porque está el industry con el mismo nombre (Banking)

Primera Solución: Que en caso de subfiltro, solo guarde en el array si está dentro de paréntesis

________________________________

Input 2:

Automotive (All Verticals)

Banking (Universal Banks)

Output:

AND OPV.IndustryName in (
	'Automotive',
	'Banking'
)

AND IPV.VerticalName in (
'Universal Banks',
'Banking',
'Vehicle Supplier',
'Vehicle OEM',
'Mobility Services'
)

Peer review tiene que:

-Revisar que estén todos los industries y todos los verticals, que no sobre ninguno - CHECK

-Si los verticals están perfectos, pueden sobrar industries o que no haya ninguno, pero tiene que ser AND - check

-Si hay un solo industry, y es All Verticals, puede no haber verticals, pero, si hubiera otro industry, tienen que estar todos sus verticals - check

Lógica Unknown:

-Si pidieron Unknown, tiene que estar el industry en el filtro NULL, y no pueden sobrar - CHECK

- El OR de Unknown tiene que estar dentro del paréntesis con el AND

- Puede no haber Unknown si hay un sólo industry all verticals - check

- Si es All verticals, puede tanto estar en el filtro de NULL como no - CHECK



Para evitar problemas con \n replace por ""








SDSs usually must analyze meticulously the information received through MaSH filters in Service Requests. This often involves converting the data into the required format for the specific task and platform, like SQL Code Scripts for the UCMP database or values for Marketo programs.

This leads to human errors, that vary depending on the builder of the task, adds unnecessary time dedicated to analyze the request, and harms the quality of the process.

Here in the right image we have an example of a typical service request filter and as you can see...the text bubble isn't happy either.

Checking some numbers, since the beginning of the FY26 

forty seven percent of the tasks included segments or industries, 

seventy two percent included audience filters and - this is the most important number - forty six percent of the tasks included both categories, which implies duplicating the manual analysis of the request.


So the idea here...is called FieldFlex.


With the FieldFlex tool, this analysis process is eliminated. The text extracted directly from the MaSH filters is automatically converted into the required format, based on the filter, and task involved, saving two-to-fourteen minutes from the time effort.

This ensures:

Standardization & Quality of the process across centers

Less margin error or rejection percentage for the data team, globally

and Less time per MaSH stage, avoiding task delays

So we are moving from...

So now moving to the best part I'm going to show you the magic trick.



______________________________

Respuesta a "el porcentaje de los filtros es bajo".

The presence of the filters on the service requests is increasing this FY as I explained before, not just for the filters individually but for the combinations of them, implying more time dedicated to manual analysis.



Respuesta a "no hay rejections de eso": 


- New joiners are more likely to have rare errors.  

- No matter how many filter errors there are in the current season, we are avoiding and anticipating fatal errors.  

- We standardize a part of the process that many SDS do in different ways.

- Even new joiners can see their errors by themselves using the peer section, improving the learning curve.




Respuesta a "Ya usan la función de Excel CONCATENATE u otros métodos":

- Then here we have a standardized solution for a process that many SDS do in different ways, which even new joiners can use to see their errors by themselves using the peer section, improving the learning curve.
